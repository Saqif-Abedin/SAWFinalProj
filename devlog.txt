Devlog Rules:
Devlog allows any group member at any time to see the current state of the project.
PM will make sure devlog is being maintained, but will not make all entries.
When any team member stops working and pushes changes to github, they should update the devlog explaining what changes have been made. Include errors/bugs discovered (or created).
Separate devlog entries with a newline.
Most recent entry at the bottom.
Each entry should begin with the following format: firstL -- TIMESTAMP\n ( e.g.: topherM -- 1999-12-31 23:59 )

Complete redesign of main template
Formatted table and wrote javascript code that submits form
Wrote function to add new entry to table, update the database, and display
Wrote function to set budget and update database
Removed some irrelevant code
Current TODO:
	-Warn user when expense takes them over budget
	-Fix issue where if the expense is more than budget, current budget is displayed as 0 instead of negative like it should be
	-When setting a new budget, reset all entries of the table. Not sure if database should be purged as well.
	-Format table display, it looks terrible rn
	-Allow user to return to previous page after error
	-Allow user to delete previous entries individually
	-Aesthetic changes (CSS, Bootstrap, Templating)
	-Add logout button on main.html
	-Various other features?
